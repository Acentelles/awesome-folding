# Applications

- [Nova-Scotia](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/Nova-Scotia)
    - This repository provides necessary middleware to take generated output of the Circom compiler (R1CS constraints and generated witnesses) and use them with Nova as a prover.
- [Lurk](https://github.com/lurk-lang/lurk-rs)
    - Lurk is a Turing-complete programming language for recursive zk-SNARKs. It is a statically scoped dialect of Lisp, influenced by Scheme and Common Lisp.
